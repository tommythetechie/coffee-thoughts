                <p>Space; a destination that mankind has dreamed about for centuries. It was only a dream until recently, and as technology developed and improved, Earth finally put a human being on the moon. We have sent ships as far as mars, but out of all of these trips, still only a handful of humans have actually been in space. We have barely scratched the surface of the final frontier, and yet these small trips have cost millions of dollars.</p>
                <br>
                <p>That being said, what if someone had an idea that would reduce the cost of space travel immensely, and in turn, open up an infinite number of space travel destinations. What if we could place a human being on Mars, or even Pluto? An idea that would allow such possibilities would have to be so crazy, people would claim that it was straight out of a Science Fiction novel. Enter the Space Elevator - an idea that made it to the mainstream via Arthur C. Clark's "The Fountains of Paradise", a science fiction novel written in 1979.</p>
                <br>
                <P>Simply put, the Space Elevator - as of today's current design - will be a cable that reaches far into space and will be attached to a counterweight such as the International Space station, perhaps, or another device. It will have the power to rise up and down, and bring people to space and back down to Earth.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-title">Python, the Cool Kid</h2>
                <span class="post-time"><time>Feb 28th 2019 / News / Tom Chapman</time></span>

                <p>This seems to be a hot question on the Internet these days - Should I learn Python? Anyone that knows me should know already that I love Python (am I Python expert? Not even close - this will make for a great topic to talk about on another day, though). Python is super versatile and it's not really a hard language to learn. It's one of the hottest languages right now actually. A quick google search will bring up the "top languages of the year" and Python is on all of them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>That being said, why is it hot? is it because it's an older language that's got tons of support and it's mature or is it hot for another reason?</p>
                <br>
                <blockquote>The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code -- not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death.</blockquote>
                <br>
                <p>Let's start with the first half of that question. Python has been around since the early 1990s, although it never really was cool until a few years ago. I learned a lot about Python around 2000-2004; Something about it got my attention and just compelled me to learn it. I wasn't the best at it (I was in high school and just then learning how to program â€“ I wasn't very good, really.) Anyway, that's a topic for another day again.</p>
