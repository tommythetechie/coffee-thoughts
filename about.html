                <blockquote>I am a Web Designer and Online Strategist that specializes in creating WordPress blogs for bloggers who need an online brand in order to increase traffic sales.</blockquote>
                <br>
                <p>I was born and raised in Nashville, TN - one of the hottest growing cities in the US right now. (Probably because word got out that I live here, right?) When I got my first computer and then discovered the Internet in the 90s, one of the first things I did that same week was search for books on how to write code to do what the websites did, and I've never looked back. I've spent countless hours knee deep in computer hardware and code both over the years.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I've got a huge passion for what I do and I consider myself a technology enthusiast. I love fixing code problems and creating solutions for people that solve their blogging and website problems. I've worked with local people and businesses here in the middle TN area as well as many corners of the world like Canada and Ireland and Hawaii.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One of my biggest interests is blogging - so that's what I love to focus on. I love writing code and creating branding for websites, but I also love blogging so you'll find me blogging about blogging here - trying to power you up with tips and tricks that I've learned over the years. </p>
